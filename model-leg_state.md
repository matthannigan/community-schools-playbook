This bill is modeled off of Minnesota Statute [124D.231](https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=124D.231), New York [S 3481](http://legislation.nysenate.gov/pdf/bills/2017/S3481), and Tennessee [SB 2393](http://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bills/110/Bill/HB2472.pdf).

This model legislation provides funding for a competitive grant program to support the implementation of a community schools’ initiative. Two categories of grants are authorized: (1) planning grants; and (2) implementation and renewal grants. One-year planning grants enable local education agencies (LEAs) (the applicant), in partnership with the community and participating school(s), to prepare to apply for implementation grant(s) (i.e. conducting a needs and assets assessment(s) and drafting community school plan(s)). LEAs may bypass planning grants if prepared to apply directly for implementation grants. Implementation grants provide funding to transform schools into community schools in accordance with the four pillars approach found in the Learning Policy Institute and National Education Policy Center’s research on effective community schools. Renewal grants are provided to sustain community school initiatives. The model legislation is not exhaustive. States may augment the bill to better contextualize the content or move some of the text into accompanying regulations or requests for proposals (see Appendix). Likewise, states may choose to change the structure of this bill, such as by creating a formula grant program or reprogramming and aligning existing funds.

##### SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE

This Act shall be called the “Community Schools Act.”

##### SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE

###### (A)  FINDINGS - The legislature finds that:

<ol class="leg_1">
   <li>Every child should be able to grow up and have the opportunity to achieve his or her dreams and contribute to the well-being of society. Every neighborhood deserves a public school that fully delivers on that promise.</li>
   <li>According to the most recent data, more than half of the nation’s school children live in low-income households—meaning they qualify for free or reduced-price lunch, the highest proportion since this statistic began being documented over sixty years ago. As a result, some schoolchildren face more challenges than others in succeeding in school and in life.</li>
    <li>Community schools provide comprehensive programs and services that are carefully selected to meet the unique needs of students and families —such as lack of stable housing, inadequate medical and dental care, hunger, trauma, and exposure to violence— so students can do their best.</li>
    <li>According to a report from the Learning Policy Institute, the four key pillars of the community schools approach—integrated student supports, expanded and enriched learning time and opportunities, family and community engagement, and collaborative leadership and practice—promote conditions and practices found in high-quality schools, as well as address out-of-school barriers to learning.</li>
    <li>Research shows that community school interventions can result in improvements in a variety of student outcomes, including attendance, academic achievement (including reducing racial and economic achievement gaps), and high school graduation rates, and meet the Every Student Succeeds Act standard of “evidenced-based” approaches to support schools identified for comprehensive and targeted support and intervention.</li>
    <li>Research also shows that these programs offer a strong return on investment: 10 to 15 dollars for every dollar invested in community schools.</li>
</ol>

###### (B)  PURPOSE

  <dl>
  <dd>This law is enacted to support the successful implementation of effective community schools that provide all students with equitable access to a high-quality education.</dd>
