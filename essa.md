### [Hawaii](http://www.hawaiipublicschools.org/DOE Forms/ESSA/HawaiiESSAPlanApproved.pdf)
###### Date approved by DOE: 1/19/2018

Hawaii’s ESSA Plan includes community schools as a potential evidence- and research-based strategy for school improvement. This discussion is included in a section about rigorous interventions for schools that fail to meet the state’s exit criteria.  

The plan also describes community schools’ six-part strategic approach as: “1) Curricula that are engaging, culturally relevant, and challenging; 2) Emphasis on high-quality teaching, not on high-stakes testing; 3) Wraparound supports such as health care, eye care, and social and emotional services that support academics; 4) Positive discipline practices, such as restorative justice and social and emotional learning supports; 5) Authentic parent and community engagement; and 6) Inclusive school leadership.” Pg. 63.

###### Date approved by DOE: 8/30/2017

Illinois’ ESSA Plan lists “Full-Service Community School Programs” as a use for Title IV, Part F funds to, along with several other initiatives funded under Title IV, “coordinate state-level strategies in order to reduce exclusionary discipline, implement evidence-based behavioral health awareness training programs, expand access for school-based counseling and behavioral health programs, and improve outcomes of children living in the most distressed communities.” Pg. 106.

The plan also explains that the Illinois State Board of Education “acknowledges the impact of the community school model as it embeds family engagement as a core pillar for school and student success. Community schools strengthen opportunities for schools and partners from across the community to come together to educate and support students and families in building thriving communities.” Pg. 109.

Ohio’s ESSA Plan also lists community learning centers as part of its Ohio Improvement Process, which is a “framework to establish systemic collaborative structures within schools and districts designed to support development and implementation of a strategic improvement plan and focused goals.” Also, the ESSA Plan explains that “[t]o assist schools and districts in educating the whole child, especially Ohio’s most vulnerable students, the Department will develop and share information regarding implementation of community learning center models.” Pg. 52.

Pennsylvania’s ESSA Plan extensively discusses community schools. Pennsylvania’s Vision for Public Education, as described in the ESSA Plan, includes a community schools initiative.
