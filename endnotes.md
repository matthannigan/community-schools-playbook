Note that while this kind of help is especially beneficial to poor children, who otherwise do without, middle class families would also benefit from the after-school and summer activities; what’s more, having a clinic on the premises means that a parent doesn’t have to leave work for their child’s doctor’s appointment. |

| 6  | Child Trends describes integrated student supports this way: “Integrated student supports (ISS) are a school-based approach to promoting students’ academic success by developing or securing and coordinating supports that target academic and non-academic barriers to achievement. These resources range from traditional tutoring and mentoring to provision of a broader set of supports, such as linking students to physical and mental health care and connecting their families to parent education, family counseling, food banks, or employment assistance. While ISS programs take many forms, integration is key to the model—both integration of supports to meet individual students’ needs and integration of the ISS program into the life of a school.” Moore, K.A., Emig, C.
