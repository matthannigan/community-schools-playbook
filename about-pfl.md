The [Partnership for the Future of Learning](https://futureforlearning.org/) protects, strengthens, and advances education equity and meaningful learningâ€”and supports the policies and practices that get us there.

The Partnership for the Future of Learning is housed and supported by the [National Public Education Support Fund](https://www.npesf.org/).
